We developed a novel testing model (7) for a well-defined criterion. We developed a novel testing model (7) for a well-defined criterion. We used a novel testing model (7) to define approximate marginal posteriors for scalar metrics, as well as joint posteriors for ROC and P-R analysis. We introduced MMSE testing and de- veloped empirical Bayes algorithms for iteratively finding the MMSE estimate of the testing-model parameters from z,y,
